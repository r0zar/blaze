# Vision for Blaze

## Purpose
Blaze aims to make web3 applications indistinguishable from web2 applications in terms of user experience, while providing developers with the tools to leverage blockchain capabilities without sacrificing speed, usability, or accessibility.

## Core Principles
1. **Web2-level UX** - Eliminate blockchain friction points to create seamless user experiences
2. **Instant Responsiveness** - Enable real-time transaction confirmations with no perceptible delay
3. **Security Without Compromise** - Maintain cryptographic guarantees while abstracting complexity
4. **Developer Simplicity** - Provide intuitive APIs that web developers can integrate with minimal blockchain knowledge
5. **Flexible Integration** - Allow developers to choose how much of the blockchain is exposed to end users

## Target Audience
- Web3 developers seeking to create mainstream-ready applications
- Traditional web developers looking to add blockchain capabilities
- Applications requiring high-frequency, low-value transactions
- Games and interactive applications requiring real-time feedback

## Long-term Vision
Transform the web3 development landscape by enabling applications where the underlying blockchain technology becomes invisible to end users while still providing all the benefits of decentralization, security, and ownership.
